# 2048 Game with Reinforcement Learning - Final Project

This is the final project for the SoC 2048: Reinforcement Learning course. I have uploaded all the necessary files to create a 2048 game with an interface. You will need to sync these files with your environment's path.

There are three Python files included in the project that require completion with appropriate logic and values. Your task is to fill in the incomplete sections and run the entire project. Upon successful completion, you should be able to see a fully functional 2048 game.

If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, please let me know.
